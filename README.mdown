Welcome to my GitHub, feel free to look around,

This is the current code for my personal website, it was built using:

*   [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com)
*   [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
*   [Compass](http://compass-style.org)
*   [HAML](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
*   [SASS](http://sass-lang.com)
*   Written using [Sublime Text Editor](http://www.sublimetext.com/)

Also, feel free to try check it out on different devices or just
resize the browser window. By utilizing bootstrap and @media selectors
I've designed my website to (hopefully!) look great on any screen size!

Thanks for stopping by!
